Jotting down the steps I took and my thinking process for each phase of the project. 
This will help with my analysis and methodology section in my dissertation. 

Data collection
Started by locking down a single, reliable data source before experimenting with models.
Used hourly Bitcoin OHLCV data to capture short-term volatility without excessive noise.
Fetched the data once and stored it locally to keep the dataset fixed and reproducible.

Feature engineering
Focused on a small, defensible set of indicators rather than adding every technical signal available.
Engineered log returns and rolling volatility to represent how price variability evolves over time.
Added volume-based features to capture liquidity shocks often associated with volatility spikes.
Included RSI and MACD as contextual momentum indicators, not trading rules.

Spike definition
Framed the task as volatility spike prediction, not price forecasting.
Defined a spike as an unusually large short-term price movement relative to historical behaviour.
Labeled spikes using a top-quantile threshold within a short future horizon to keep the definition data-driven.
 
Label construction
Used a look-ahead window only to label historical data, never as model input.
Computed thresholds on the training period only to avoid temporal leakage.
Recorded spike direction separately to allow optional directional analysis later.
